* When studying the translation regulatory features, do we compare the abundance and composition of these of the general cytosolic mRNA VS the efficiently translated mRNA?
	* What happens if, for example, there is a similar codon usage? Would that mean it is not a feature specific of translation regulation?
- Do chromatin state is related with abundance of RNA in cell? Given the fact that RNA abundance allows histones solubility. See work of Marianne Farnedo.
* Are ASOs derived from uORFs? siRNAs?
* BRCA2 does not work when treated with ASOs?
