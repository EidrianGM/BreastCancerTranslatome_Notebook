* When studying the translation regulatory features, do we compare the abundance and composition of these of the general cytosolic mRNA VS the efficiently translated mRNA?
	* What happens if, for example, there is a similar codon usage? Would that mean it is not a feature specific of translation regulation?
- Do chromatin state is related with abundance of RNA in cell? Given the fact that RNA abundance allows histones solubility. See work of Marianne Farnedo.
* Are ASOs derived from uORFs? siRNAs?
* BRCA2 does not work when treated with ASOs?
* Translational efficiencies, translatome, polysome-associated? All are referred to the same phenomena?
* If the main hypothesis of translatome regulation is that there are specific genes whose translation is not correlated with their transcription (which additionally depends on biological context, i.e. external stimulli)
	* ARE LINEAR MODELS ONLY USED TO DISCARD GENES WHOSE TRANSLATION CORRELATES DIRECTLY WITH THEIR TOTAL EXPRESSION? 
	* DOES IT MAKES SENSE TO USE LINEAR MODELS TO LOOK FOR PREDICTORS?
