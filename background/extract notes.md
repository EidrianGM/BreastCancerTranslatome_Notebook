 5’UTRs differ in length between different specie

 in human the median length is 218nt but can reach up to approximately 1200nt (

 variations in length and the combinatorial

 nucleotide composition, result in many possibilities for regulation

 5’UTR complexity can be modulated by RNA splicing, since around 35% of 5’UTR sequences contain introns

 ), which have been found to be longer compared to those in coding regions

 The actual 5’UTR characteristics are determined by usage of transcription start sites (TSS), who can be differentially selected in response to altered cellular condition

 mRNAs with very short 5’UTRs (≤20nt) show lower translational efficiency resulting from increased leaky scanning, which can result in N-terminal truncated protein

 . However some mammalian mRNAs with very short 5’UTRs contain an element that promotes cap-dependent but scanning independent initiation. The translation initiation of short UTRs (TISU) element, often found in mitochondrial related mRNAs

 , promotes translation of 5’UTRs as short as 5nts and relies on specific sequences up and downstream of the AUG,

 1.3.2.2 Structures and sequence motifs in the 5’UTR

 5’UTRs are prone to form secondary structures

 n. Longer 5’UTRs are more likely to form structures, show different requirements for translation initiation factors compared to shorter sequences

 Higher levels of eIF4E increase translation of mRNAs with higher structural content in the 5’UTR due to higher

 demand of eIF4F complex formation, involving RNA helicases like the ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A

 Shorter, less structured 5’UTRs show lower dependency on eIF4A, while at the same time being to some extend more mTOR-dependen

 the ability to repress is more pronounced, when the AUG codon of the uORF lies in a strong Kozak context

 ). Increasing distance between 5’cap and uORF-AUG codon results also in stronger reduction of main-ORF translation supporting the notion of more efficient initiation at uORFs while having a more robust scanning of the 43PIC (

 nterestingly, there is no substantial difference between 5’UTRs harboring an isolated uORF versus uORFs overlapping with the main ORF (Ca

 With decreasing distance of the uORF in respect to the main ORF a reduced reinitiation potential could be observed using the pre-proinsulin mRNA

 in mouse, human and zebrafish, which showed a depletion of uORF start-codons towards the main ORF(C

 The start codons of uORFs, as defined by mapping translation initiation sites, are composed of 25% AUG, 30% CUG, with the majority being AUG variants (UUG, GUG, AGG, AACG, AAG, AUC, AUA, AUU) of around 41% (Lee

 . The second mechanism involves a peptide originating from the uORF stalling the 80S ribosome therefore acting as a roadblock to the scanning 43PIC, which did not initiate at the uORF AUG due to leaky-scanning (W

 Additionally, an inhibitory peptide functions as an antizyme for the expression of different ornithine-decarboxylase homologs mediating polyamine-induced repression of the main-ORF, in which interestingly the start codon of the regulatory uORF is an AUU codon (

 A proportion of PIC proceeds to scan without available ternary complex resulting in increased leaky scanning on start codons. This bypassing of uAUG codons subsequently leads to initiation at the main ORF under stress

 ost transcripts encoding for such genes with low susceptibility to stresses contain these uORFs leading to their low translational efficiency of their main ORF in stress-free conditions,

 Another example is ATF4, a transcription factor leading to induction of CHOP and GCN4, leading to cell death if stress conditions persist (

 Two major uORFs in the ATF4 mRNA modulate translation by initiating at a short uORF upstream of a second uORF,

 which overlaps with the main ORF. The remaining ternary complex at the stop codon of this uORF, initiates after 60S dissociation at the overlapping uORF preventing translation of ATF4.

 When ternary complex is limited, initiation at the overlapping uORF is decreased leading to ATF4 expression
