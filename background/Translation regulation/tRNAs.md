* Elongation of synonymous codons is not equally efficient 
* Elongation fidelity can be impaired by neighboring codons
* Ribosomal pausing alters mRNA stability
* Relationship between codon composition and decoding tRNA availability 
	* expression level of tRNAs correlates with the frequency of codons in mRNAs in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes, also taking into account that each amino acid can be decoded by several codons
	* tissue-specific transcription of tRNAs reflecting codon-adaptation of highly expressed genes
	* distinct tRNA expression related to proliferation, metastatic potential and differentiation with concomitant codon-usage in subsets of mRNAs
* Global protein synthesis is linked to mTOR-dependent stimulation of tRNA synthesis by RNA pol III and translational decrease mediated by phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 due to increasing levels of uncharged tRNAs. These mechanism alter translation globally although tRNAs play a clear role.
* Posttranscriptional modifications of tRNAs (wobbling-modifications)
	* A melanoma model revealed tumorigenesis and resistance to targeted therapy related to altered codon usage of HIF1α- dependent on wobbling-modifications
	*  U34 position
		* catalyzed by a cascade of 3 different enzymes complexes, generating a 5-methoxycarbonyl-methyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2 U) at position 34 in the tRNA, which leads to increased decoding efficiency of AAA and AAG (Lysine, tRNAUUU); CAA and CAG (Glutamine, tRNACUC); GAA and GAG (Glutamic Acid, tRNA UUC), rendering mRNAs enriched in these codon
sensitive to U34 modifications
