#### The mTOR pathway
* Downstream of PI3K and MAPK
* mTOR is evolutionary conserved Ser/Thr-kinase
* Major regulator for cell proliferation and cell growth. 
* Three distinct complexes of mTOR: 
	* mTORC1 = mainly regulates mRNA translation, activated by hormones and growth factors through the PI3K pathway upon stimulation of RTK, i.e. the insulin receptor. Dowstream cascade signals via AKT and TSC1/TSC2 to RAS-homologue enriched in brain (Rheb), which, acting as a GTPase, activates mTORC1 in its GTP-bound state. 
		* Its activation increase mRNA translation by phosphorylating the p70-S6 and and eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BPs)
		* S6Ks, mTORC1 downstream key player regulating cellular and organismal size, namely rpS6 is involved in ribosome biogenesis
		* eEF2K is a negative regulator of mRNA translation by inhibiting eEF2. Insulin stimulation leads to inhibition of eEF2K activity resulting in increased protein synthesis due to higher elongation rate
		* 4E-BPs when hypo-phosphorylated under low mTORC1 activity, bind to eIF4E and thereby reduces its affinity for the 5’cap, abolishing binding of eIF4G and therefore inhibiting translation initiation resulting in decreased protein synthesis

	* mTORC2 = mediating the stability of PKC, phosphorylates nascent AKT polypeptides and plays a role in actin and cytoskeleton reorganization
	* mTORC3 = mTOR + ETV7

#### The integrated stress response

* eIF2α phosphorylation leads to global decrease of mRNA translation
* Mediated by four different kinases PERK, GCN2, PKR and HRI
	* Each kinases is activated by different cellular stresses such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, low amino acid availability, heme levels or as part of antiviral response
* Specific mRNAs translation induced by phospho-eIF2α span from specific transcription factors (ATF4, CHOP), protein processing and degradation (BiP, BACE1), Cell cycle control (CDKN1A), feedback control for eIF2α phosphorylation (GADD34), nutrient transport (SLC35A4) and tRNA charging (EPRS)
* Using the ER-stress inducer thapsigargin, that one such translational program acts as a first response, and chronic stresses leads to transcriptional reprogramming

#### MNKs and eIF4E phosphorylation

* eIF4E cap-binding protein is phosorilated/regulated by MAP kinase signalintegrating serine/threonine-protein kinases (MNKs) by docking onto eIF4G
* MNKs, exist in two isoforms, and are activated directly by
	* ERK, downstream of the RAS pathway 
	* p38, downstream of the MAP kinase pathway
 * MNK2 plays a role in resistance to rapamycin in cancer cells due to sustained mTORC1-activity
 * MNKs are the only known kinases that phosphorylate eIF4E at Serine 209
 * The precise role of eIF4E-phosphorylation in context of global mRNA translation remains unclear.
