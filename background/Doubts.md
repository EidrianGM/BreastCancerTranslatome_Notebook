- "By modifying the canonical AUG to single-nucleotide mutants it was shown that initiation is reduced."
	- Modifications of AUG are not directly stop function?
- "The eIF1 mRNA harbors an AUG in weak context leading to increased eIF1 translation when eIF1 protein levels are low." 
	- Why being in a weak kozak context there is increased translation?
- The start codons of uORFs, as defined by mapping translation initiation sites, are composed of 25% AUG, 30% CUG, with the majority being AUG variants (UUG, GUG, AGG, AACG, AAG, AUC, AUA, AUU) of around 41%.
	- But is it no supposed to be always AUG the starting codon with the obtaining of Methionine
	- What is the 10% missing?
	- Why variants of AUG and not CUG? 
- "Translation initiation is commonly considered the rate limiting step in protein synthesis"
	* Only initiation or also the scanning?
* "The codons AAG and AGG were shown as non-functional"
	* Understood as these in the place of AUG? or in the context?
* Non-canonical start codons is referred to other than AUG or to a different surrounding context of AUG ? 
*  "Secondary structures, related to GC-content, proximal to the 5’cap impede eIF4F complex formation" 
	* High or low % of GC-content ???
* "RNAs can be reversibly modified by covalent bound, generating N$^6$-methyladenosine (m$^6$A) or N$^1$-methyladenosine (m$^1$A)"
	* Only methyl groups are added?
* "uORFs are generally considered to regulate translation by reducing initiation of main ORFs, especially when several uORFs are present"
	* More than one uORF can be present in the ORF ?
* "A peptide originating from the uORF stall the 80S ribosome acting as a roadblock to the scanning 43PIC, which do not initiate at the uORF AUG due to leaky-scanning"
	* Starts with a leaky-scanning or produces/requires a leaky-scanning?
* "Around 35% of 5’UTR sequences contain introns" 
	* 65% contain exons?'
* Do mRNAs with extrem short 5'UTR, <5nts, that contain TISU element only rely on eIF1?
* All TISU elements require eIF1?
* "mRNAs with higher structural content"
	* These are simply longer 5'UTRs? or with high GC%?
* "GC content proximal to the 5’cap impede **eIF4F** complex formation"
	* High or low %GC ?
* "TOP-mRNA translation is highly dependent on activity of mTORC1, moreover as depletion of amino acids leads to mTORC1 inactivation, reduced activity of S6K and rpS6 phosphorylation. Subsequently it was shown that alterations of S6K and P-rpS6 do not impact TOP-mRNA translation"
	* But if TOP-mRNA depends on mTORC1, but its inactivation does not impact TOP-mRNA translation there is something that I missing right? 
* "This revealed that, given that each amino acid can be decoded by several codons, expression level of tRNAs correlates with the frequency of codons in mRNAs in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes"
	* Is there also correlation between aminoacids usage and tRNAs expression level?
