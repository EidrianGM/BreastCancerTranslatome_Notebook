* Aberrant proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, energy metabolism and alterations in immune response are considered hallmarks of cancer and can occur as a consequence of dysregulated mRNA translation.
* Protein synthesis is one of the most energy-demanding processes in the cell
* Many of the pathways altered in cancer converge on mRNA translation:
	* Oncogenes -> favour proliferation 
		* MYC, CDK2, Mcl-1, survivin, VEGF
			* high dependency towards eIF4E
				* MYC activates eIF4E
		* RAS, RAF
			* Hyperactivation of MNKs pathway increase levels of **eIF4E phosphorylation**:
				* These are elevated in human prostate cancer and drive translation of SNAIL and MMP3 towards mastasis.
				* Overexpression of eIF4E in NIH-3T3 cells led to malignant transformation
				* Synergistic effects between eIF4E and c-MYC have been found to lead to lymphomagenesis
				* Also attributed to polarization of tumor-associated macrophages, depending on Mnk2, associated with an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype, proposed to counter cancer-progression driven by differential mRNA-translation
		* PTEN
		* PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway -> activated in malignancies
			* stimulates formation of the eIF4F translation initiation complex, which bolsters cap-dependent translation
		* Many of their mRNAs encoding proto-oncogenes harbor long and highly structured 5’UTRs or uORFs, which in turn require higher levels and activity of cap-dependent translation and initiation factors such as eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A (eIF4F complex) or alterations of ternary complex and start codon recognition by eIF2α, eIF1 and eIF5.
		* Also affects elongation factors (eEFs) or tRNA modifications 
	* Tumor suppressors -> stops proliferation and favour apoptosis
	* Ribosomal proteins or ribosome biogenesis -> ribosomopathies
	* Translation factors (besides eIF4E)
		* eIF4G (increased expression) 
		* eIF4A (increased expression) 
		* 4E-BP (increased and decreased expression)
		* eIF2α
* Therapeutic targets
	* Inhibitors for mTORC1 and mTORC2: 
		* asTORin (INK128, Torin1, PP242)
	* inhibitors of the initiation factors 
		* eIF4E by cap-analogues 
		* eIF4A by silvestrol, Hippuristanol or Pateamin A
	*  inhibition of upstream kinases such as MNK 
		* cercosporamide; promising effects on metastasis mediated by phosphorylation of eIF4E
	* eIF2α phosphorylation
		* a non-phosphorylatable mutant leads to transformation of NIH-3T3 cells
		* increased levels of phosphorylation promote apoptosis
		* Compounds like BTdCPU induce eIF2α phosphorylation by the HRI kinase and salubrinal inhibits its dephosphorylation, showing promising potential in sensitizing cancer cells to undergo apoptosis
		* Prognostic marker for prostate cancer, which when elevated, leads to tumor progression in a model carrying PTEN and MYC mutations bolstering the burden of high protein synthesis rates in tumors. These effects could be reversed by ISRIB a small molecule that reactivates eIF2α function despite its phosphorylation state by binding to eIF2B, leading to selective cell death of prostate cancer cells
