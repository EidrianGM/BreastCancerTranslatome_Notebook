 Inci S. Aksoylu paper -> **Transcriptome-wide alterations in mRNA translation define breast cancer subtypes**

* Results
	* wide-spread heterogeneous variation in mRNA translation across patients
	* six subsets of subtypes of breast cancer, independent of cell-composition, that were also validated in the second patient cohort, that point to selective regulation of translation
		* Different from the PAM50 subtypes
		* Driven by interactions between:
			* Translation programs downstream of translation initiation factors including eIF4E, eIF4A and DAP5, 
			* key signalling pathways
				* mTOR
				* the integrated stress response (ISR) 
				* extracellular matrix
			* Cis-regulatory in 
				* 5'UTR
				* CDS
				* 3'UTR
			* Upstream signalling events emanating from intracellular and extracellular queues
