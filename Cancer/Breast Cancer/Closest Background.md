 Inci S. Aksoylu paper -> **Transcriptome-wide alterations in mRNA translation define breast cancer subtypes**

* Data
	* Two cohorts of breast cancer patients
	* Polysome-profiling optimized for small samples 
		* Transcriptome-wide patterns of mRNA translation
* Results
	* wide-spread heterogeneous variation in mRNA translation across patients
	* six subsets of subtypes of breast cancer, independent of cell-composition, that were also validated in the second patient cohort
