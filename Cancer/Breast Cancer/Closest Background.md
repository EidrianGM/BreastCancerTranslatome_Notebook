 Inci S. Aksoylu paper -> **Transcriptome-wide alterations in mRNA translation define breast cancer subtypes**

* Data
	* Two cohorts of breast cancer patients
	* Polysome-profiling optimized for small samples 
		* Transcriptome-wide patterns of mRNA translation
* Results
	* wide-spread heterogeneous variation in mRNA translation across patients
	* six subsets of subtypes of breast cancer, independent of cell-composition, that were also validated in the second patient cohort, that point to selective regulation of translation
		* Driven by interactions between:
			* Translation programs downstream of translation initiation factors including eIF4E, eIF4A and DAP5, 
			* key signalling pathways
				* mTOR, 
				* the integrated stress response (ISR) 
				* extracellular matrix
			* Cis-regulatory in 
				* coding sequences
				* non-coding sequences of targeted mRNAs
