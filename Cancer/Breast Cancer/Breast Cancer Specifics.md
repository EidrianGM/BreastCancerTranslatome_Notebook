* Overexpression of the splicing factor SRSF1 which affects alternative splicing
* Using the ER-stress inducer thapsigargin, that one such translational program acts as a first response, and chronic stresses leads to transcriptional reprogramming
* MNK2 plays a role in resistance to rapamycin in cancer cells due to sustained mTORC1-activity
* Inhibitors for eIF4A as possible cancer treatment
* Breast cancer stratifications
	* Traditional Intrinsic or PAM50 - Based on hormone receptors expression
		* Hormones receptors:
			* HR - Hormone receptor:
				* ER - Estrogen receptor 
				* PR - Progesteron receptor
			* HER2 - Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
		* Subtypes:
			1. Luminal A:
				- **Characteristics:** HR +, HER2 -
				- **Prognosis:** Slow-growing. Generally favorable prognosis.
				- **Treatment:** Often treated with hormone therapy.
			2. Normal-like:
				- **Characteristics:** Rare and shares similarities with normal breast tissue.
			3. Luminal B:
				- **Characteristics:** HR +, HER2 - or +.
				- **Prognosis:** More aggressive than Luminal A, but still generally favorable.
				- **Treatment:** Often treated with a combination of hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.
			4. HER2-enriched:
				- **Characteristics:** HR + or -, HER2 +
				- **Prognosis:** Can be aggressive, but targeted therapy against HER2 can significantly improve outcomes.
				- **Treatment:** Often treated with targeted therapy against HER2, chemotherapy, and sometimes hormone therapy.
			5. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or Basal-Like:
				- **Characteristics:** HR - (ER - and PR -), HER2 -
				- **Prognosis:** Variable, but often more aggressive and less responsive to standard treatments.
				- **Treatment:** Primarily treated with chemotherapy, and sometimes targeted therapy or immunotherapy.
	- **Lehmann TNBCtype** **Subtypes**
		1. **Basal-like 1 (BL1)**:
		    - Characterized by high expression of genes involved in cell cycle and DNA damage response.
		    - Often shows increased proliferation.
		    - May respond well to DNA-damaging agents like platinum-based chemotherapy, as well as PARP inhibitors, especially in BRCA-mutated cases.
		2. **Basal-like 2 (BL2)**:
		    - Characterized by growth factor signaling pathways and metabolic processes.
		    - Generally has a poor prognosis.
		    - BL2 tumors are challenging to treat due to limited targeted therapies, although studies are exploring potential targeted therapies for these pathways.
		3. **Mesenchymal (M)**:
		    - Involves genes associated with cell motility, differentiation, and growth.
		    - Shows features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), making it more invasive.
		    - May respond to targeted therapies aimed at EMT pathways or therapies targeting the tumor microenvironment.
		4. **Luminal Androgen Receptor (LAR)**:
		    - Characterized by high expression of androgen receptor (AR) signaling genes.
		    - This subtype may respond to anti-androgen therapies, similar to treatments used in prostate cancer, as AR signaling drives tumor growth here.
		5. **Immunomodulatory (IM)**: - OBSOLETE emebeded in the others
		    - Enriched with immune cell signaling genes, indicating an active immune environment.
		    - This subtype may respond to immunotherapy agents, like checkpoint inhibitors, which can stimulate an anti-tumor immune response.
		6. **Mesenchymal Stem-like (MSL)**: - OBSOLETE
		    - Similar to the Mesenchymal subtype but includes stem cell-like features.
		    - Tumors are enriched with genes associated with EMT and stem cell-like characteristics.
		    - There is ongoing research into targeted therapies that can disrupt these pathways.
