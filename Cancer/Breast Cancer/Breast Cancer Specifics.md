* Overexpression of the splicing factor SRSF1 which affects alternative splicing
* Using the ER-stress inducer thapsigargin, that one such translational program acts as a first response, and chronic stresses leads to transcriptional reprogramming
* MNK2 plays a role in resistance to rapamycin in cancer cells due to sustained mTORC1-activity
* Inhibitors for eIF4A as possible cancer treatment
* Breast cancer stratifications

		* Subtypes are:
			1. Luminal A:
				- **Characteristics:** Hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, and slow-growing.
				- **Prognosis:** Generally favorable prognosis.
				- **Treatment:** Often treated with hormone therapy.
			2. Luminal B:
				- **Characteristics:** HR positive, HER2 negative or positive, and more aggressive than Luminal A.
				- **Prognosis:** More aggressive than Luminal A, but still generally favorable.
				- **Treatment:** Often treated with a combination of hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.
			3. HER2-positive:
				- **Characteristics:** HR positive or negative, HER2 positive, and aggressive.
				- **Prognosis:** Can be aggressive, but targeted therapy against HER2 can significantly improve outcomes.
				- **Treatment:** Often treated with targeted therapy against HER2, chemotherapy, and sometimes hormone therapy.
			4. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC):
				- **Characteristics:** HR negative, HER2 negative, and often more aggressive.
				- **Prognosis:** Variable, but often more aggressive and less responsive to standard treatments.
				- **Treatment:** Primarily treated with chemotherapy, and sometimes targeted therapy or immunotherapy.
