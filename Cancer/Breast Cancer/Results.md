## Quantification of mRNA translation in breast cancer patients

* Total mRNA perfectly classify according to PAM50 classification
* Polysomal mRNA fails to group together samples according to PAM50

## Abundant variation in mRNA translation across breast cancer patients

* I don't really understand how this analysis is carried out, but it basically consist in two steps:
	1. Adjust input matrix to all possible covariates:
		* Cell populations abundance
		* Clinical variables
		* Sequencing biases ?
			* Library Size:
				* Total reads ?
				* Total unique reads ?
				* Average read length ?
	 2. Measure how many genes are translationally dysregulated.
* Results: Many genes are translationally dysregulated

## Transcriptome-wide alterations in mRNA translation define breast cancer subtypes

* There are 6 subtypes of shared patterns of rewired mRNA translation across breast cancer patients
	* These appeared to be distinct from PAM50 subtypes
	* Their clinical annotations does not define them
* These subtypes can be divided according to 4 different gene sets
