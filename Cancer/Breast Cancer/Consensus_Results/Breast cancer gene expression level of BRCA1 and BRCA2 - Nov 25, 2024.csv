"Expression and mutations of BRCA in breast cancer and ovarian cancer: Evidence from bioinformatics analyses.","BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes show elevated expression levels in breast cancer and ovarian cancer tissues, with common mutations and proteins involved in their interaction networks.","Zhu Wang, Jian-wen Zhang, Ying Zhang, Q. Deng, Hui Liang",2018,25,"Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) are the most well‑known genes linked to breast cancer and ovarian cancer, which are crucial in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. The present study aimed to elucidate the expression profiles, mutations and interaction networks of BRCA1 and BRCA2, which may provide insights to reveal the mechanisms of BRCA genes ultimately leading to breast or ovarian tumorigenesis. Bioinformatics analyses were performed in the present study. The mRNA levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were evaluated using FIREHOSE analysis, SAGE Genie tools and Oncomine analysis. cBioPortal analysis, and Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer analysis were used to examine the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Kaplan‑Meier Plotter analysis was performed to identify the prognostic roles of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The results of the present study showed that the mRNA expression levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were elevated in breast cancer and ovarian cancer tissues, compared with their matched normal tissues. Second, several common mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were identified in breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Finally, neurofibromin 1, synaptonemal complex protein 2 and tumor protein 53 were predicted to be involved in the interaction network of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Taken together, these results provide a significant insight into certain mutations and proteins involved in the interaction network of BRCA1 and BRCA2, which may have common roles in breast cancer and ovarian cancer. However, the complex mechanism underlying these observations remains to be fully elucidated, and further investigations are required in the future.","non-rct in vitro","International journal of molecular medicine","1","10.3892/ijmm.2018.3870","https://consensus.app/papers/expression-mutations-brca-breast-cancer-cancer-evidence-wang/7001cf33562a5dff8b1c5c08f1e36b3d/"
"Expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins and their correlation with clinical staging in breast cancer.","Decreasing BRCA1 expression in breast cancer cases may be linked to a compensatory increase in BRCA2 protein, depending on tumor grade and menopausal status.","S. Hedau, Madhu Batra, U. Singh, A. Bharti, A. Ray, B. Das",2015,26,"OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of expression of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in sporadic breast cancer cases to determine the functional role of these genes in breast carcinogenesis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Paraffin embedded histologically proven invasive breast tissue sections that were obtained from 40 patients and the adjacent normal breast tissue sections used as controls to determine breast carcinoma specific changes in the expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC).


RESULTS
Majority of the cases express either low or no detectable level of BRCA1 expression in tumor tissues in comparison with control; the decline in BRCA1 expression was found to be more prominent in advanced grade 3 disease. On the other hand, the expression of BRCA2 protein was moderate or low in breast cancer cases and its overall distribution did not show significant difference when compared with controls. Interestingly, those breast cancer cases, which were found to express low or no BRCA1 expression, demonstrated a higher protein level of BRCA2. The inverse correlation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression was more prominent in post-menopausal patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results demonstrate in a subset of cases that decline in BRCA1 expression that may be associated with potentially compensatory increase in BRCA2 protein, which may depend on tumor grade as well as menopausal status.","non-rct observational study","Journal of cancer research and therapeutics","3","10.4103/0973-1482.140985","https://consensus.app/papers/expression-brca1-brca2-proteins-correlation-staging-hedau/483e60cc92fb5736a113dbd3d67f717d/"

Loman, O. Johannsson, Hampus Olsson, B. Wilfond, G. Sauter, O. Kallioniemi, Å. Borg, J. Trent",2001,973,"BACKGROUND
Many cases of hereditary breast cancer are due to mutations in either the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene. The histopathological changes in these cancers are often characteristic of the mutant gene. We hypothesized that the genes expressed by these two types of tumors are also distinctive, perhaps allowing us to identify cases of hereditary breast cancer on the basis of gene-expression profiles.


METHODS
RNA from samples of primary tumor from seven carriers of the BRCA1 mutation, seven carriers of the BRCA2 mutation, and seven patients with sporadic cases of breast cancer was compared with a microarray of 6512 complementary DNA clones of 5361 genes. Statistical analyses were used to identify a set of genes that could distinguish the BRCA1 genotype from the BRCA2 genotype.


RESULTS
Permutation analysis of multivariate classification functions established that the gene-expression profiles of tumors with BRCA1 mutations, tumors with BRCA2 mutations, and sporadic tumors differed significantly from each other. An analysis of variance between the levels of gene expression and the genotype of the samples identified 176 genes that were differentially expressed in tumors with BRCA1 mutations and tumors with BRCA2 mutations. Given the known properties of some of the genes in this panel, our findings indicate that there are functional differences between breast tumors with BRCA1 mutations and those with BRCA2 mutations.


CONCLUSIONS
Significantly different groups of genes are expressed by breast cancers with BRCA1 mutations and breast cancers with BRCA2 mutations. Our results suggest that a heritable mutation influences the gene-expression profile of the cancer.","non-rct in vitro","The New England journal of medicine","1","10.1056/NEJM200102223440801","https://consensus.app/papers/geneexpression-profiles-breast-cancer-hedenfalk/2243974cda5059f1ab3ee7142926f82a/"

"Differentially expressed genes and key molecules of BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer: evidence from bioinformatics analyses","BRCA1/2 mutations influence gene expression, revealing potential biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer patients.","Yue Li, Xiaoyan Zhou, Jiali Liu, Yang Yin, Xiaohong Yuan, Ruihua Yang, Qi Wang, Jing Ji, Qian He",2020,14,"Background BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are currently proven to be closely related to high lifetime risks of breast cancer. To date, the closely related genes to BRCA1/2 mutations in breast cancer remains to be fully elucidated. This study aims to identify the gene expression profiles and interaction networks influenced by BRCA1/2 mutations, so as to reflect underlying disease mechanisms and provide new biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis or prognosis. Methods Gene expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were downloaded and combined with cBioPortal website to identify exact breast cancer patients with BRCA1/2 mutations. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to analyze some enriched pathways and biological processes associated BRCA mutations. For BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer, wild-type breast cancer and corresponding normal tissues, three independent differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis were performed to validate potential hub genes with each other. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks, survival analysis and diagnostic value assessment helped identify key genes associated with BRCA1/2 mutations. Results The regulation process of cell cycle was significantly enriched in mutant group compared with wild-type group. A total of 294 genes were identified after analysis of DEGs between mutant patients and wild-type patients. Interestingly, by the other two comparisons, we identified 43 overlapping genes that not only significantly expressed in wild-type breast cancer patients relative to normal tissues, but more significantly expressed in BRCA1/2-mutant breast patients. Based on the STRING database and cytoscape software, we constructed a PPI network using 294 DEGs. Through topological analysis scores of the PPI network and 43 overlapping genes, we sought to select some genes, thereby using survival analysis and diagnostic value assessment to identify key genes pertaining to BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer. CCNE1, NPBWR1, A2ML1, EXO1 and TTK displayed good prognostic/diagnostic value for breast cancer and BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer. Conclusion Our research provides comprehensive and new insights for the identification of biomarkers connected with BRCA mutations, availing diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer patients.","non-rct in vitro","PeerJ","1","10.7717/peerj.8403/fig-4","https://consensus.app/papers/differentially-expressed-genes-molecules-brca12mutant-li/67a615989d7f5135a3d1f8b6cd5fb300/"
"Expression profile of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in premenopausal Mexican women with breast cancer: clinical and immunohistochemical correlates","Low BRCA1 mRNA expression is associated with younger ages and advanced clinical stages of premenopausal breast cancer, while BRCA2 expression is not associated with disease severity in young breast cancer women.","Gloria Loredo-Pozos, E. Chiquete, A. Oceguera-Villanueva, A. Panduro, F. Siller-López, M.

However, expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes has not been completely characterized in premenopausal BC. We analyzed the clinical and immunohistochemical correlates of BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression in young BC women. We studied 62 women (mean age 38.8 years) who developed BC before the age of 45 years. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA expression was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and that of HER-2 and p53 proteins by immunohistochemistry. Body mass index (BMI) ≥27 (52%) and a declared family history of BC (26%) were the main risk factors. Ductal infiltrative adenocarcinoma was found in 86% of the cases (tumor size >5 cm in 48%). Disease stages I–IV occurred in 2, 40, 55, and 3%, respectively (73% implicating lymph nodes). Women aged ≤35 years (24%) had more family history of cervical cancer, stage III/IV disease, HER-2 positivity, and lower BRCA1 expression than older women (P < 0.05). BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression correlated in healthy, but not in tumor tissues (TT). Neither BRCA1 nor BRCA2 expression was associated with tumor histology, differentiation, nodal metastasis or p53 and HER-2 expression. After multivariate analysis, only disease stage explained BRCA1 mRNA levels in the lowest quartile. Premenopausal BC has aggressive clinical and molecular characteristics. Low BRCA1 mRNA expression is associated mainly with younger ages and advanced clinical stage of premenopausal BC. BRCA2 expression is not associated with disease severity in young BC women.","non-rct observational study","Medical Oncology","2","10.1007/s12032-008-9114-7","https://consensus.app/papers/expression-profile-brca1-brca2-genes-premenopausal-women-loredopozos/7f6617d804245e5db43e56c20703275a/"
"Pathology and gene expression of hereditary breast tumors associated with BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 gene mutations","BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast tumors show specific pathological and gene expression profiles, with BRCA2 tumors showing a phenotype similar to sporadic tumors but overexpress DNA repair markers like CHEK2, RAD51, and HER-2.","E. Honrado, A. Osorio, J. Palacios, J. Benítez",2006,107,"Tumors arising in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers appear to have specific pathological and gene expression profiles, which show a high level of concordance. BRCA1 tumors are high-grade, negative for hormone receptors, have a high proliferation rate, and are positive for some cell cycle promoter genes. BRCA2 tumors present a phenotype opposite to BRCA1 tumors but very similar to sporadic tumors, except that BRCA2 overexpress some DNA repair markers such as CHEK2, show high cytoplasmic expression of RAD51, and are negative for HER-2 amplification and expression. Some of these characteristics have also been found in cDNA expression studies, although more analysis are necessary in order to obtain new markers that can be associated with a germ line mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. In this way, some studies in normal tissues of BRCA1/2 carriers suggest that differences exist in the level of expression of some genes when compared with noncarriers. Finally, IHC studies in tumors carrying a mutation in CHEK2 are rare and show contradictory results, probably due to the low number of these cases. However, they represent an example showing how different mutations of the same gene may be associated with specific histological subtypes of cancer.","","Oncogene","1","10.1038/sj.onc.1209875","https://consensus.app/papers/pathology-gene-expression-breast-tumors-associated-brca1-honrado/61b1e1c9bc7154fc9f54c72192b63f12/"

Chodosh",1998,37,"Current evidence strongly supports a role forthe breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, in both normal development and carcinogenesis.Valuable clues regarding the function of these genes have been garnered through studies of theirpatterns of expression. A central feature of the in vivopattern of BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression is that each ofthese putative tumor suppressor genes is expressed at maximal levels in rapidly proliferatingcells. This feature is consistent with in vitroobservations that BRCA1 and BRCA2 are expressed in acell cycle-dependent manner. This feature is also wellillustrated during mammary gland development wherein theexpression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is induced in rapidlyproliferating cellular compartments undergoingdifferentiation, such as terminal end buds duringpuberty and developing alveoli during pregnancy.Strikingly, the spatial and temporal patterns of BRCA1and BRCA2 expression are virtually indistinguishableduring embryonic development and in multiple adulttissues despite the fact that these genes areunrelated.

"Quantifying BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA Isoform Expression Levels in Single Cells","This study demonstrates that BRCA1/2 mRNA expression is stochastically expressed in single cells, offering a more comprehensive understanding of spliceogenic variants' influence on mRNA isoform expression.","Vanessa Lattimore, J. Pearson, A. Morley-Bunker, kConFab investigators, A. Spurdle, B. Robinson, M. Currie, L. Walker",2019,1,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 spliceogenic variants are often associated with an elevated risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Analyses of BRCA1 and BRCA2 splicing patterns have traditionally used technologies that sample a population of cells but do not account for the variation that may be present between individual cells. This novel proof of concept study utilises RNA in situ hybridisation to measure the absolute expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA splicing events in single lymphoblastoid cells containing known spliceogenic variants (BRCA1c.671-2 A>G or BRCA2c.7988 A>T). We observed a large proportion of cells (>42%) in each sample that did not express mRNA for the targeted gene. Increased levels (average mRNA molecules per cell) of BRCA2 ∆17_18 were observed in the cells containing the known spliceogenic variant BRCA2c.7988 A>T, but cells containing BRCA1c.671-2 A>G were not found to express significantly increased levels of BRCA1 ∆11, as had been shown previously. Instead, we show for each variant carrier sample that a higher proportion of cells expressed the targeted splicing event compared to control cells. These results indicate that BRCA1/2 mRNA is expressed stochastically, suggesting that previously reported results using RT-PCR may have been influenced by the number of cells with BRCA1/2 mRNA expression and may not represent an elevation of constitutive mRNA expression. Detection of mRNA expression in single cells allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how spliceogenic variants influence the expression of mRNA isoforms. However, further research is required to assess the utility of this technology to measure the expression of predicted spliceogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants in a diagnostic setting.","non-rct in vitro","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","1","10.3390/ijms20030693","https://consensus.app/papers/quantifying-brca1-brca2-mrna-isoform-expression-levels-lattimore/8802c81b3a24595cae970475d04cdc50/"
"Genome-Wide Gene Expression Analyses of BRCA1- and BRCA2-Associated Breast and Ovarian Tumours","Gene expression analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant carriers has shown promise for identifying cancer risk, but consistency in phenotype descriptions across different tissue types is needed for accurate variant classification.","G. Wiggins, L. Walker, J. Pearson",2020,5,"Simple Summary Variants in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. Over the past two decades researchers have aimed to identify gene expression changes associated with high-risk BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. In this review we explore the replicability of BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated gene expression profiles in diseased and normal tissue. We highlight the impact of experimental factors and study designs on the comparability and utility of gene expression profiles associated with high-risk BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. Additionally, we emphasise the importance of controlling for confounding molecular features that may influence the design of study cohort groups. Abstract Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase cumulative lifetime risk up to 75% for breast cancer and 76% for ovarian cancer. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants has become an important part of clinical practice for cancer risk assessment and for reducing individual risk of developing cancer. Genetic testing can produce three outcomes: positive (a pathogenic variant), uninformative (no pathogenic variant) and uncertain significance (a variant of unknown clinical significance). More than one third of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants identified have been classified as variants of uncertain significance, presenting a challenge for clinicians. To address this important clinical challenge, a number of studies have been undertaken to establish a gene expression phenotype for pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant carriers in several diseased and normal tissues. However, the consistency of gene expression phenotypes described in studies has been poor. To determine if gene expression analysis has been a successful approach for variant classification, we describe the design and comparability of 23 published gene expression studies that have profiled cells from BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers. We show the impact of advancements in expression-based technologies, the importance of developing larger study cohorts and the necessity to better understand variables affecting gene expression profiles across different tissue types.","literature review","Cancers","1","10.3390/cancers12103015","https://consensus.app/papers/genomewide-gene-expression-analyses-brca1-wiggins/b53ac6f004055f91a742d7a7897bcbe4/"
