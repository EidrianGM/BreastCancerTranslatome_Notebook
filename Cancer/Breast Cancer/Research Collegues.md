List of researchers and their work on Breast Cancer just in case

## Nearby (around KI)

**Maria Angeliki Toli,** main supervisor Theodoros Foukakis
“Ki-67 dynamics during neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer and their added prognostic value to the Neo-Bioscore model: a population-based cohort study”

**Nick Tobin**. nick.tobin@ki.se. Focused on integration of multiple high-throughput data, very computational. https://ki.se/en/people/nick-tobin. He has a mailing list BRECT where they share and talk about bioinformatics methods about cancer analysis in general but also with breast cancer.
