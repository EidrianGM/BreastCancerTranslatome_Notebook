## Status

## Background

1. Inci Sevval Aksoyu thesis paper [unpublished]()
2. Johannes Ristau thesis

## Objectives
1. Try to scrutinise the method of Inci and replicate the results 
2. Study clinical variables correlation with breast cancer subtypes discovered by Inci (see Figure 3 of last paper, III, in thesis)?
3. Study the consistency of signatures and cell lines correlation found by Inci (Figure 5) ?
4. Study survival signatures of breast cancer available publicly and correlate it with our current signatures in each subtype.
## Lab's Ideas
* Ola's:
	* Revisit the subtypes by taking each gene/residual information of transcriptome/translatome and adjust it to the total mRNA in each sample

## My Ideas
1. Study the applicability of pathmed R's  package to our data
2. Study MyProSLE method, characterise subtypes with functional modules, to study our data, do we need treatment response or logitudinal data?
