Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)
* Synaptic remodeling in Striatum is correlated with ASDs
* How is translation regulated in striatum?
	* Samples: Mouse post natal 10d and 28d
	* 10d
		* mTOR dependency 
		* autophagy activated
	* 28d
		* mTOR independency
	* Anota2Seq results
		* Neurological processes enriched in translation down
		* Muscle development en translation offset down
		* Codon usage
			* if a codon appears in the in the diagonal is not differentially used
