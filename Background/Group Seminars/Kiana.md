Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs)
* Synaptic remodeling in Striatum is correlated with ASDs
* How is translation regulated in striatum?
	* Samples: Mouse post natal 10d and 28d
	* 10d
		* mTOR dependency 
		* autophagy activated
	* 28d
		* mTOR independency
	* Anota2Seq, now postnet, results
		* Neurological processes enriched in translation down
		* Muscle development en translation offset down
		* Codon usage
			* if a codon appears in the in the diagonal is not differentially used
			* AtTract (RNABPs curated database) in place of lenght of UTR
		* Transacting factors
			* Would they also appear as significant in a enrichment analysis? 

How can we talk about percentages in different translation regulation modes, when we are actually analyzing subsets of genes?? Arent this models percetanges of percentage?
How to differentiate between batch effect and real importance in the anota2seq tables results measured in variance explained?
Is it the dependency between anota2seqUtils variables controlled, studied, reviewed?

Targeting mRNA translation to reverse resistance to endocrine therapy

Translation elgongation focus.

tRNA the most heavily modified form of RNA important to maintain the dynamics of elongation.
Dicodons can explain the different elongation translations:
