* Elongation of synonymous codons is not equally efficient 
* Elongation fidelity can be impaired by neighboring codons
* Ribosomal pausing alters mRNA stability
* Relationship between codon composition and decoding tRNA availability 
	* expression level of tRNAs correlates with the frequency of codons in mRNAs in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes, also taking into account that each amino acid can be decoded by several codons
	* tissue-specific transcription of tRNAs reflecting codon-adaptation of highly expressed genes
	* distinct tRNA expression related to proliferation, metastatic potential and differentiation with concomitant codon-usage in subsets of mRNAs
* Global protein synthesis is linked to mTOR-dependent stimulation of tRNA synthesis by RNA pol III and translational decrease mediated by phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 due to increasing levels of uncharged tRNAs. These mechanism alter translation globally although tRNAs play a clear role.
* Posttranscriptional modifications of tRNAs (wobbling-modifications)
	*  U34 position modifications
		* Catalyzed by a cascade of 3 different enzymes complexes
		* Generating a 5-methoxycarbonyl-methyl-2-thiouridine (mcm$^5$s$^2$U) at position 34 in the tRNA
		* Leads to increased decoding efficiency of
			* AAA and **AAG** (Lysine, tRNA$^U$$^U$$^U$)
			* CAA and **CAG** (Glutamine, tRNA$^C$$^U$$^C$)
			* GAA and **GAG** (Glutamic Acid, tRNA $^U$$^U$$^C$),
		* mRNAs enriched in previous codons are sensitive to U34 modifications
		* Wobbling leads to decoding of the previous G-ending codons
			*  In parallel synonim tRNAs are expressed:
				* tRNA$^C$$^U$$^U$ (Lysine)
				* tRNA$^C$$^U$$^G$ (Glutamine)
				* tRNA$^C$$^U$$^C$ (Glutamic Acid)
		* Examples:
			* A melanoma model revealed tumorigenesis and resistance to targeted therapy related to altered codon usage of HIF1α- dependent on wobbling-modifications
			*  The unfolded protein response (UPR) during brain development
			* Breast cancer progression
			* Tumorigenesis in the intestine
	*  Loss of U34 modifications in yeast led to increased ribosomal densities at AAA, CAA and GAA codons suggesting ribosomal-pausing at codons ending with A. However it did not reduce global protein levels, rendering translation initiation as rate-limiting.
	* Impaired elongation has been shown to affect protein folding and has been proposed to be related to a hydrophilic pentapeptide encoded by the mentioned A-ending codons leading to protein aggregation and decreased expression. 
	* Distinct translational programs can also be related to levels of U34 modifying enzymes and mRNAs requiring U34 modifications
