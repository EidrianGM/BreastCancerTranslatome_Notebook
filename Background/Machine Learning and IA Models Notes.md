## Linear Regression - R::lm()
- Statistical model that analyzes the relationship between a response variable (often called y) and one or more variables and their interactions (often called x or explanatory variables)
- Basic formula:
	- Result | Expected | Target = Intercept + (Variable|Predictor) * Slope
		- Intercept = base line measurement
		- Variable | Predictor =  (~clinical, ~technical, ~cell populations, ...)
		- Slope = measures the change of results according to variable
- Assumption:
	- Linear relationship between the response and the outcome
	- In our context, figure out which variables explain the amount of mRNA being translated (~clinical, ~technical, ~cell populations, ...)
- Results indexes / coefficients:
	- Intercept and Variable
	- RÂ² =
