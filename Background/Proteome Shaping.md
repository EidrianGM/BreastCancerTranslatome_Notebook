* Cell phenotypes are mainly shaped by their proteome
* Depends on mRNAs
	* Transcription
	* Trasnportation
	* Translation -> protein levels
		*  massive changes in perturbed systems, such as intracellular stresses and rapid adaptations to extracellular stimuli 
	* Degradation 
* Proteins levels
	* mRNAs translation
	* Protein degradation
* Several studies show that mRNA and protein levels correlate imperfectly
	* In contrast to context-dependent studies that claim protein-levels being mainly explained by mRNA levels
* Proteome
