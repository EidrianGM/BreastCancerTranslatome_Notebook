PRO-seq (Precision Run-On Sequencing) offers single nucleotide resolution of nascent RNA 3' ends. This information can be used to identify candidate enhancer RNAs and profile the immediate transcriptional effects of experimental perturbations such as drug-treatment, cell differentiation, or protein degradation. 

The method involves permeabilization of cells followed by a nuclear run-on assay in which engaged RNA polymerase complexes incorporate a single biotinylated nucleotide into the nascent RNA chain. These labeled RNAs are enriched using streptavidin beads and sequencing of the final libraries reveals RNA 3’ ends at single nucleotide resolution.

The sensitivity of this method permits detection of changes in gene expression at timepoints earlier than possible with bulk RNA based methods like RNA-seq. This has two key benefits:

1. Detection of direct transcriptional effects of experimental perturbations
2. Shorter treatment times with drug or protein degradation yield healthier cells which result in fewer confounding effects of cell stress in the data.
